Snow!
=====

Javascript / Canvas-based snow.

Requirements:
=============
You'll need:

1. Prototype - http://www.prototypejs.org

Instructions:
=============

1. Add a div to contain your snow:
<div id="my_snow"></div>

2. Create a snow field. Snow fields need a width, a height, and (optionally) a renderer:
var snowField = new SnowField("my_snow", { width: 750, height: 400, renderer: 'canvas' });

3. Add some snow:
snowField.addFlakes(350);

Additional Features:
====================

You can stop and start the snow:
snowField.stop(); snowField.start();

Rendering engine selection:
===========================
Snow has a flexible rendering architecture, and includes renderers for canvas, CSS and SVG.
